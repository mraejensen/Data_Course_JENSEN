BBA_ID: unique point identified. Block name (two numbers, one letter, two numbers) followed by point number within block (two numbers)

GPS_N: Northing in decimal degrees (NAD 1983)

GPS_W: Easting in decimal degrees (NAD 1983)

Observer: Four-letter observer code

Date: data of point count

Start: start time of point count

Temp: Temperature Record temperature in degrees Celsius

Q1: Wind Speed
0-less than 1 km/h, (calm, smoke rises vertically)
1 - 1-5 km/h, (smoke drift shows wind direction)
2 - 6-11 km/h, (leaves rustle, wind felt on face)
3 - 12-19 km/h, (leaves, small twigs in constant motion; light flag extended)
>3 Large branches and small trees in leaf begin to sway, Don’t count!

Q2: Precipitation

3 = hemlock dominated forest (>50%)

Q5: Rank level of hemlock health (e.g., due to adelgid infestation)
0 = N/A or all hemlocks appear healthy
1 =beginning dieback; many trees still appear healthy
2 = much dieback; some standing dead hemlocks
3 = many dead hemlocks; remaining trees suffering dieback

0 = not applicable or native (northern PA; high elevation only)
1 = scattered ornamental plantings (near houses)
2 = reforestation planting (away from houses)
3 = unknown

Q8: Rank extent of ericaceous forest understory (Laurel, Rhododendron, Azalea)
0 = not applicable (no forested habitat present)
1 = none or sparse (<10% of understory)
2 = moderate (10-50% of understory)
3 = dense (>50% of understory)

Q9: Rank degree of deer browse impact on understory
0 = not applicable
1 = none evident 
2 = some impact evident
3 = strong browse line evident

3 = Other

Q11: Pastured livestock and/or working barn?
0 = none
1 = fenced livestock in count circle
2 = barn in count circle
3 = both 1 and 2 in count circle

Q12: Rank presence of natural nesting cavities
0 = predominantly open environment with no snags
1 = predominantly open environment with scattered snags
2 = predominantly forested environment with few or no snags
3= predominantly forested environment with many snags

Q13: Rank presence of nest boxes

1 = bird house(s) in residential yard setting
2 = nest box trail along fence line
3 = both 1 and 2

Q14: Indicate road type
1 = Paved, primary road (2-lane, usu. w/painted lines)
2 = Paved, secondary road (1-2 lanes, maybe no lines)
3 = Gravel (wide, general use)
